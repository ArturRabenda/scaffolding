# Implement a Car class with following methods
# start - starts engine and sets its speed to a number given in options as start_speed symbol or to 0
# accelerate/1 - which should accept a number of km to accelerate,
# stop - which should stop the car
# start, accelerate, and stop should take care of controlling car's engine(lib/engine.rb)
# current_speed - should return cars speed as a string in format: "Current speed is X km/h"
#
# implement this class in a way to prevent engine from reporting Engine errors
# make it possible to chain start, accelerate, and stop methods
